## Description

Azure Horizon is more than just a project for me â€” it started back in 2021 as a demo for my first job, but it slowly grew into something personal. I began with Django templates, but as I evolved, so did the project. Now itâ€™s powered by Django REST Framework on the backend and Next.js on the frontend, giving it both flexibility and scalability.  

Why Django REST Framework? Because it provides a clean and robust way to structure APIs, making it perfect for scalability and future integrations.  

Why Next.js? Because I wanted a fast, modern frontend thatâ€™s SEO-friendly with features like Server-Side Rendering â€” essential for when this turns into a real resortâ€™s digital presence.  

And why TailwindCSS? Because I like clean, maintainable code. Tailwind makes it easy to design without bloating CSS files, while still keeping everything consistent and sharp.  

At the end of the day, Azure Horizon isnâ€™t just code. Itâ€™s my dream to one day bring it to life as a real resort with its own digital platform.
